R code for Clark et al. (2021) "The abuse of popular performance metrics in hydrologic modeling", _Water Resources Research_, doi:<10.1029/2020WR029001>.

This package is intended to quantify the sampling uncertainty in goodness of fit statistics, such as KGE or NSE, which are commonly used for calibrating the parameters of hydrological models.

The package gets its name because it uses bootstrapping to solve water-related problems.
