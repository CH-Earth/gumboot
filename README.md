R code for Clark et al. (2021) "The abuse of popular performance metrics in hydrologic modeling"

This package is intended for examining the distribution of errors in goodness of fit statistics, such as KGE or NSE, which are commonly used for calibrating the parameters of hydrological models.

The package gets its name because it uses bootstrapping to solve water-related problems.
