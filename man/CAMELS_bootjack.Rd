\usage{
CAMELS_bootjack(
  CAMELS_sites = NULL,
  NetCDF_file = NULL,
  sim_var = "kge",
  GOF_stat = c("NSE", "KGE"),
  nSample = 1000,
  waterYearMonth = 10,
  startYear = NULL,
  endYear = NULL,
  minDays = 100,
  minYears = 10,
  seed = NULL,
  bootYearFile = NULL,
  quiet = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{CAMELS_sites}{Required. Data frame of CAMELS sites. Must contain a field called \option{hcdn_site}. The data frame
\code{hcdn_conus_sites} will work. You can subset this data frame if you want to use fewer sites.}

\item{NetCDF_file}{Required. NetCDF file containing CAMELS modelled and gauged flows.}

\item{sim_var}{Required. Name of variable containing simulated flows in \code{NetCDF}.}

\item{GOF_stat}{Required. Name(s) of simulation goodness of fit statistic(s) to be calculated. Currently both \code{NSE} and \code{KGE} are supported.}

\item{nSample}{Required. Number of samples for bootstrapping.}

\item{waterYearMonth}{Required. Month of beginning of water year. Default is \code{10}
(October). If the calendar year is required, set \code{waterYearMonth = 13}.}

\item{startYear}{Optional. First year of data to be used. If \code{NULL} then not used.}

\item{endYear}{Optional. Last year of data to be used. If \code{NULL} then not used.}

\item{minDays}{Required. Minimum number of days per year with valid (i.e. greater than 0) flows. Default is 100.}

\item{minYears}{Required. Minimum number years to be used. Default is 10.}

\item{seed}{Optional. If \code{NULL} (the default) then no seed is specified
for the random number generator used for the bootstrapping. If a value is specified
then the bootstrapping will always use the same set of pseudo-random numbers.}

\item{bootYearFile}{Optional. If \code{NULL} (the default) the years used for
the bootstrapping are neither output nor input. If a file is specified, and it
it does not already exist, then the bootstrap years will be written to a .csv
file as a table with the dimensions of years x nSample. If a file is specified,
and it _does_ exist, then the years will be read in, and used for the bootstrapping.}

\item{quiet}{Optional. If \code{FALSE} (the default) a progress bar is displayed. If \code{TRUE},
it is not.}
}
\value{
Returns a data frame containing the following variables:
\describe{
 \item{\code{CAMELS_site}}{CAMELS site number}
 \item{\code{lat}}{CAMELS site latitude}
 \item{\code{lon}}{CAMELS site longitude}
 \item{\code{GOF_stat}}{Goodness of fit statistics (i.e. NSE or KGE)}
 \item{\code{seJack}}{standard error of jacknife}
 \item{\code{seBoot}}{standard error of bootstrap}
 \item{\code{p05, p50, p95}}{the 5th, 50th and 95th percentiles of the estimates}
 \item{\code{score}}{the jackknife score}
 \item{\code{biasJack}}{the bias of the jackknife}
 \item{\code{biasBoot}}{the bias of the bootstrap}
 \item{\code{seJab}}{the standard error of the jackknife after bootstrap}
}

\description{
Hydrologic model simulations can be produced using input-response data
from the 671 catchments in the CAMELS dataset (Catchment Attributes and MEteorology
for Large-sample Studies). Newman et al. (2015) and Addor et al. (2017)
provide details on the hydrometeorological and physiographical characteristics of
the CAMELS catchments. The CAMELS catchments are those with minimal human disturbance
(i.e., minimal land use changes or disturbances, minimal water withdrawals), and are
hence almost exclusively smaller, headwater-type catchments (median basin size of 336 km^2^).
The CAMELS data used for the large-domain model simulations are publicly available at the
National Center for Atmospheric Research at \url{https://ral.ucar.edu/solutions/products/camels}.
